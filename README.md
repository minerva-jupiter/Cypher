Cypher

This is a new cryptographic technique we propose.

This is based on the principle of duplicate combination.

We hope it will be one of the counter-quantum computer cryptography.

・tipe "createKey" to create keyFile for Cryptography.

・tipe "encrypt" to encrypt the date file you want with created keyFile.

・tipe "sort" to sort the encrypted file with keyFile.

Open file and try more!
